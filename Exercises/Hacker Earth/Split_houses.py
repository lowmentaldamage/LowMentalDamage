# Village rules:
# 'H' = house, '.' = empty space, 'B' = fence
# 1. Place fences to divide village into sections.
# 2. No person can reach another person’s house.
# 3. Each person must reach the same number of grids (including their house).
# 4. If multiple solutions exist, maximize the number of fences.


n = int(input())    # Number of grids
